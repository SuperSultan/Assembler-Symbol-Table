PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

This is the symbol table, implemented as a hash table that will be used by 
the assembler during pass 1 and pass 2.

The main routine creates a hashtable object and reads the fileinput as a 
list called content.

For each line in content, if the length is 2, the line is inserted into 
the table. Otherwise, if the length is 1, the line is searched, printing 
whether or not the string is found or not.

INPUT AND HOW TO EXECUTE: 

The input file is a file, and the project is executed  by entering "p1 
filename" on the command line, where "filename" is any name of the user's 
choosing. "p1" is an ASCII linux shell script that executes the project.

OUTPUT: 

There is no output file, the output is simply printed on the screen.
